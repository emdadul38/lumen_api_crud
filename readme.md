# Simple Lumen 5.4 CRUD Demo

Laravel Lumen is a stunningly fast PHP micro-framework for building web applications with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable, creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Lumen attempts to take the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in the majority of web projects, such as routing, database abstraction, queueing, and caching.

## Setup

Let's install all packages, by running this command from Terminal
````base
composer install
````

Migration install

```bash
composer migrate
````

And run the web server
```bash 
php -S localhost:8000 -t public 
````


## Official Documentation

Documentation for the framework can be found on the [Lumen website](http://lumen.laravel.com/docs).
